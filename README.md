## About

'The Book Hub' is a Book recommendation system for all avid readers out there who are always on the look-out for their next book. It is overwhelming to choose your next book from a pool of millions with different authors and various genres available. This project aims to provide you with accurate recommendations for your next favorite book. 

The Goal of this project is to create a web app that helps the user find similar books of his/her preference with the help of search as well as recommendation algorithms. The website is also integrated with goodreads.com that provides the users with the book description, rating as well as user reviews.
